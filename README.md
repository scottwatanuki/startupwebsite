# startupwebsite
This project is an informational website that I developed as a side project with a focus on how various exponential technologies are playing a big role in developing the "next" big breakthrough.

The exponential technologies introduced in the website are based off of the book titled, "The Future Is Faster Than You Think: How Converging Technologies Are Transforming Business, Industries, and Our Lives (Exponential Technology Series)."
