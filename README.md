# startupwebsite
This project is an informational website that I developed with a purpose to inform my peers on how various exponential technologies are playing a big role in developing the "next" big breakthrough across many industries.

The exponential technologies introduced in the website are based off of the book titled, "The Future Is Faster Than You Think: How Converging Technologies Are Transforming Business, Industries, and Our Lives (Exponential Technology Series)."
